# DX11Tutorial

Make sure you have the June 2010 DirectX SDK installed.
The VCPROJ setting should already be set to point to C:\Program Files x86\Microsoft DirectX June 2010 SDK\<lib or include>
Make sure this is all well and good before you start ripping your hair out over LNK-1120s.
At the moment, these are the only dependencies. (assuming you're on a windows machine of course)
